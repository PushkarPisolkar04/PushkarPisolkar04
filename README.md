# **Hi, I'm Pushkar Pisolkar! 👋**

🌍 **Jack of All Trades, Master of Fun**  
👾 Enthusiast of literally everything. If it’s a skill, I’ve probably tried it—and broken it at least once.

## What I Do:

- 🎨 **3D Modeling**: Created a Pokémon model. Ash and Goku are quaking (still not sure why my cube keeps disappearing).
- 📱 **App Dev**: Built the "IPlay" app for IP awareness. Who knew Intellectual Property could be… fun? Also, built some apps with Flutter (they work… most of the time).
- 🎥 **Animation**: Brought lessons to life with animations. Disney still hasn’t called, but hey, Pixar might!
- 🌐 **Web Development**: Built a website—don’t ask about the design choices; they’re "unique."
- 🔒 **Cybersecurity**: Currently learning to hack (legally!) and protect the world from evil—starting with my own disappearing Blender cubes.

## My Projects:
🛠️ Scattered across every field imaginable because curiosity has no chill. 

## Skills:
🧠 Basic knowledge of everything, expert at Googling.  
🌟 **Hobbies**: Breaking stuff just to fix it and calling it “debugging.”

## Philosophy:
💡 Always learning, always creating, always making technology either bend to my will or burst into flames.

🚀 If it’s tech, I’ve tried it. If it’s not, I’m probably downloading a tutorial right now.  
Let’s build, laugh, and cry over broken code together!
