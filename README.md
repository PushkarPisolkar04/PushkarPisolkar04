# **Hi, I'm Pushkar Pisolkar! 👋**

🌍 **Jack of All Trades, Master of Fun** | 👾 Enthusiast of literally everything. If it's a skill, I've probably tried it—and broken it at least once.

## 🚀 What I Do:

- 🎨 **3D Modeling**: Created a Pokémon model. Ash and Goku are quaking (still not sure why my cube keeps disappearing).
- 🎬 **Animation**: Bringing lessons to life one animation at a time. Disney hasn't called yet, but I'm ready when they do.
- 📱 **App Development**: Built the **"IPlay"** app for IP awareness (who knew IP could be fun?), and played around with Flutter for other apps.
- 🌐 **Web Development**: Built a website once. Don't ask about the design choices; they were "unique."
- 🎨 **UI/UX Design**: I design apps because someone has to make them look good while they break! Tools of choice: Figma, coffee, and lots of tweaking.
- �� **Cybersecurity**: Currently learning to hack *legally* and protect systems from evil. Pentesting, encryption, network security, you name it, I'm on it.

## 🎯 Currently Working On:

- 🔐 **Cybersecurity Intern** at Sure Trust ProEd
- 🎓 **Final Year Computer Engineering Student**
- �� **Building Cryptonix** - Advanced vulnerability scanner
- ☁️ **Learning AWS Cloud Services**

## 💡 Philosophy:

💡 Always learning, always creating, always making tech bend to my will or burst into flames.

�� If it's tech, I've tried it. If it's not, I'm probably downloading a tutorial right now.  
Let's build, laugh, and cry over broken code (and *very* secure systems) together!
