# **Hi, I'm Pushkar Pisolkar! 👋**

🌍 **Jack of All Trades, Master of Fun**  
👾 Enthusiast of literally everything. If it’s a skill, I’ve probably tried it—and broken it at least once.

## What I Do:

- 🎨 **UI/UX Design**:  
  I design apps because someone has to make them look good while they break! I’ve worked on projects like **"Foodify"** (a food delivery app more reliable than my cooking) and **"IPlay"** (an app to make Intellectual Property fun). Tools of choice: Figma, coffee, and lots of tweaking.  
  **Rule:** If it’s not intuitive, it’s not done.

- 📱 **App Development**:  
  Built the **"IPlay"** app for IP awareness (who knew IP could be fun?), and played around with Flutter for other apps. They work… most of the time.  
  **Motto:** If it doesn’t crash, it’s an upgrade!

- 🎥 **Animation**:  
  Bringing lessons to life one animation at a time. Disney hasn’t called yet, but I’m ready when they do.  
  **Ambition:** Make learning as fun as watching cartoons.

- 🌐 **Web Development**:  
  Built a website once. Don’t ask about the design choices; they were “unique.”  
  **Philosophy:** If it works, it’s perfect.

- 🔒 **Cybersecurity**:  
  Currently learning to hack *legally* and protect systems from evil. My mission? To outsmart the hackers before they outsmart us—starting with my own disappearing Blender cubes. Pentesting, encryption, network security, you name it, I’m on it.  
  **Goal:** Break things securely, fix things securely.

## My Projects:
🛠️ From **Foodify** to **IPlay**, I’ve got scattered projects across every field imaginable because curiosity has no chill.

## Skills:
🧠 Expert at Googling, average at everything else.  
🌟 **Hobbies**: Breaking things just to call it “debugging.”

## Philosophy:
💡 Always learning, always creating, always making tech bend to my will or burst into flames.

🚀 If it’s tech, I’ve tried it. If it’s not, I’m probably downloading a tutorial right now.  
Let’s build, laugh, and cry over broken code (and *very* secure systems) together!
